//! Pipelined ("two-watermark") L1 sending.
//!
//! Submission, inclusion tracking, and confirmation run as concurrent tasks joined by
//! bounded queues, so new transactions go out while earlier ones are still waiting to be
//! mined or confirmed:
//!
//! ```text
//! submitter ──(submitted queue: entries hold an unmined-slot permit)──▶ inclusion watcher
//! inclusion watcher ──(mined queue)──▶ confirmation forwarder ──▶ downstream
//! inclusion watcher ──(watch: mined-nonce floor)──▶ submitter (sim-prefix pruning)
//! ```
//!
//! The two watermarks:
//!
//! * **Unmined window** — at most `command_limit` transactions may be submitted but not yet
//!   observed mined. This matches the L1 pool's per-account cap, which counts pooled (unmined)
//!   transactions only. Each submission takes a semaphore permit that the inclusion watcher
//!   releases at the *first receipt sighting* — never at confirmation, which would keep each
//!   window slot occupied for `required_confirmations - 1` extra blocks per transaction.
//! * **Confirmation depth** — downstream forwarding still waits for `required_confirmations`,
//!   handled by a separate FIFO task so it delays forwarding by a constant without ever
//!   blocking submission.
//!
//! Invariants:
//!
//! * Nonces are assigned strictly sequentially by the single submitter; `next_nonce` advances
//!   only on a successful send. Any ambiguous send outcome (transport error) is fatal —
//!   restart + in-flight recovery is the only safe way to resolve it.
//! * Downstream forwarding is strict FIFO = nonce order = batch order (same-sender L1
//!   transactions are included in nonce order, so receipts appear in FIFO order too).
//! * Transient window overshoot (an L1 reorg can briefly return "mined" transactions to the
//!   pool after their permits were released) is absorbed by treating pool-capacity rejections
//!   as retryable with a generous budget.
//! * A transaction evicted from the L1 pool (fee spike, pool pressure) is detected by the
//!   inclusion watcher and resent at its nonce — waiting for its receipt would wedge the
//!   window forever. The old hash stays tracked in case the evicted original still mines.
//! * The L1 RPC endpoint is assumed to serve a single consistent view (one node, or sticky
//!   routing to one): startup recovery trusts a single `pending` nonce read. A backend that
//!   has not seen our pooled transactions makes the sender race its own earlier sends —
//!   still safe (single-use nonces + the contract's batch-chain check revert anything
//!   inconsistent), but each affected nonce costs wasted gas and a spurious restart.
