# devp2p / `zks` Protocols

The `lib/network` crate integrates ZKsync OS-specific peer-to-peer traffic into the node's
devp2p / RLPx network stack.

Its purpose is not to replace the node's general networking. Instead, it adds two subprotocols
multiplexed over the same RLPx connection:

1. `zks/<version>` — replay streaming from a main node to an external node
2. `zks_2fa/1` — batch-verification request / response exchange between a main node and
   verifier-capable external nodes

## High-level model

At runtime, each node is configured locally as either:

- a `MainNode`
- an `ExternalNode`

That local role determines how the node behaves on each negotiated connection:

- the main node serves replay data over `zks` and receives `VerifyBatchResult` over `zks_2fa`
- the external node requests replay data over `zks` and, if configured as a verifier, advertises
  `zks_2fa` and authenticates on it

There is no explicit "remote role negotiation" on top of devp2p. The local node chooses its
behavior from config and then expects the remote peer to behave compatibly on the negotiated
connections.

## Supported versions

- `zks/5` — the only production version registered by the Syscoin network service. It uses
  upstream's replay-only message surface (`GetBlockReplays` 0x00 and `BlockReplays` 0x01) and
  canonical v3 replay record encoding.
- `zks/0` — a bare-bones version kept in-tree for tests only. Its replay records carry just the
  block number, and the network service never registers it.
- `zks/1`–`zks/4` are retired and no longer accepted. `zks/3` and `zks/4` carried the verifier
  messages inline at message IDs 0x02–0x06; those IDs are not reused in replay-only `zks/5`.
  Their record implementations are removed; the production service does not register those
  protocol versions.
- `zks_2fa/1` — hosts the verifier handshake (`VerifierRoleRequest` 0x00, `VerifierChallenge`
  0x01, `VerifierAuth` 0x02) and batch verification (`VerifyBatch` 0x03, `VerifyBatchResult`
  0x04). Only verifier-configured ENs advertise it; the main node always does.

The `zks` subprotocol is mandatory: a peer that does not share any registered `zks` version
(e.g. a retired `zks/1`–`zks/4`-only peer, or a plain `eth` peer) is disconnected during the
RLPx handshake. `zks_2fa` is optional and never causes a disconnect on its own.

## Version lifecycle

Deployed peers negotiate a specific `zks/N` capability, so versions must evolve additively:

1. **Never change the wire behavior of a registered version.** Renumbering, stripping messages,
   or altering the record encoding of an existing version silently breaks mixed old/new fleets.
   Any change to the message surface or record encoding gets a NEW version (and, for record
   changes, a new `wire/replays/v*.rs` file) registered alongside the existing ones.
2. **Keep old versions registered through the transition.** RLPx negotiates the highest common
   version, so new↔new pairs use the new path while new↔old pairs keep working on the old one.
3. **Removing old versions is a separate, breaking change** (`feat!` with rollout instructions),
   shipped only once every deployed peer — including third-party ENs — runs a release that
   speaks the newer version. It is never done as a side effect of another change.
4. **Retired version numbers and message IDs are never reused.**

History: upstream `zks/1` through `zks/4` carried replay, with verifier messages inline in
`zks/3`/`zks/4`. Upstream moved verifier traffic to `zks_2fa/1` and defined replay-only `zks/5`
with the v3 record encoding. The fresh Syscoin V32 lane uses that format directly; historical V31
databases and replay encodings are not deployment inputs.

## Module split

- `service.rs`
  Owns the network manager, registers the `zks` and `zks_2fa` protocol handlers, consumes protocol
  events, tracks peer sessions, and dispatches `VerifyBatch` requests to eligible peers over their
  `zks_2fa` connections.
- `protocol/`
  Contains the `zks` RLPx subprotocol implementation itself.
  - `handler.rs`: bridges reth's protocol hooks into per-connection tasks
  - `mn.rs`: main-node side of one `zks` connection
  - `en.rs`: external-node side of one `zks` connection
  - `events.rs`: protocol events
  - `handler_shared_state.rs`: shared handler runtime state such as the active-connection limit
- `twofa/`
  Contains the `zks_2fa` RLPx subprotocol: verifier handshake and batch verification transport,
  plus the registry of live `zks_2fa` connections used for dispatch.
- `session.rs`
  Tracks higher-level peer session facts derived from protocol events, such as replay progress and
  verifier authorization state.
- `wire/`
  Defines the wire messages carried over devp2p (shared payload types are reused by `zks_2fa`).

## Replay flow

Replay is the `zks` protocol's sole responsibility.

1. The EN negotiates a `zks/<version>` capability over devp2p.
2. The EN sends `GetBlockReplays`, including how many records the MN may batch per response.
3. The MN streams `BlockReplays`. Syscoin currently emits one record per frame even when the EN
   requests more, keeping large transaction and preimage payloads under replay-specific
   backpressure without shrinking the control-message queue.
4. The EN forwards received replay records into its local pipeline.

Replay record encoding is versioned separately from the protocol version (`wire/replays/v*.rs`).
Syscoin `zks/5` pins the upstream v3 encoding; upgrade identity comes from the transaction the
guest executes rather than a parallel replay side channel.

## Batch verification flow

Batch verification lives in the standalone `zks_2fa` subprotocol. Peers are correlated across the
two subprotocols by their devp2p `PeerId`.

1. An EN that is configured as a verifier advertises `zks_2fa` and sends `VerifierRoleRequest`.
2. The MN replies with `VerifierChallenge`.
3. The EN signs the challenge and sends `VerifierAuth`.
4. The MN emits authorization events and tracks verifier eligibility for that peer session.
5. When the MN wants external verification for a batch, `service.rs` selects eligible peers and
   sends `VerifyBatch` over their live `zks_2fa` connections.
6. The EN-side verifier validates the request and sends back `VerifyBatchResult`.
7. The MN forwards those results into the batch-verification pipeline, which validates request ids,
   signatures, and signer membership before counting them.

## Why session tracking exists

The network service needs more than "is this peer connected right now?"

For verification dispatch, it needs to know whether a peer:

- requested replay
- has been sent replay far enough to verify a given batch
- successfully authenticated as a verifier on the current connection

That derived state is kept in `PeerSessionStore`, fed by events from both subprotocols. Live send
handles stay in the `zks_2fa` connection registry. Dispatch joins those two views:

- `PeerSessionStore` answers "who is eligible?"
- `Zks2faConnectionRegistry` answers "how do I send to them right now?"
